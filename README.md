**IDGO - A Local Passport and Gift Card System on the Arbitrum Network**


**Abstract** 

We aim to leverage the capabilities of the Arbitrum Layer 2 solution to stimulate local economies and enhance tourism. Our proposal involves developing a suite of user-friendly tools for establishing local DAOs and creating digitally-backed passports and gift cards. With this system in place, local businesses can issue digital passports and gift cards to customers and tourists. These gift cards are underpinned by staked ARB tokens, fostering a vibrant economic ecosystem within the DAO where the gift cards are universally accepted. This not only encourages local spending but also fosters a sense of community engagement and loyalty. By harnessing the speed, scalability, and affordability of Arbitrum, we anticipate creating a positive cycle of growth and engagement that benefits the entire Arbitrum community.
