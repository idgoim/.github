# IDGO - A Local Passport and Gift Card System

## Description

The IDGO Project aims to stimulate local economies and enhance tourism through blockchain technology. By developing a suite of user-friendly tools for establishing local DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), digitally-backed passports, and gift cards, the project hopes to foster a vibrant economic ecosystem.

Local businesses within these DAOs will be able to issue digital passports and gift cards to customers and tourists, backed by staked ARB tokens. This encourages local spending and fosters a sense of community engagement and loyalty, thus benefiting the entire community.

The project leverages the speed, scalability, and affordability of the Arbitrum Layer 2 solution.
